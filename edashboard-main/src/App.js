          <p id="paragraph">
            According to Peter Senge, professor at MIT and specialist in
            organizations, a learning company is a human organization that
            implements a set of practices and arrangements to stay in tune with
            its ecosystem. In the learning enterprise, all members learn from
            each other. This is what ensures the sustainable development of the
            organization.

            There are 5 key activities to develop an organization or a learning

            These activities are telefragile, and your role is to deploy or
            preserve, despite the distance, a learning spirit in your team ...
            if you want it to remain efficient, autonomous and stimulated by new
            learning!

          <p id="paragraph">
            The most effective strategy in an uncertain world is not to plan
            everything, because it is impossible. It is to strengthen the team's
            capacity to adapt, to evolve, to innovate, to improve the game as
            the unforeseen arise.
          </p>
          <p id="paragraph">
            Like the groups that intervene in uncertain situations
            (firefighters, Raid, Samu ...), you will invest time to ritualize
            moments of continuous improvement in which the team arises and takes
            stock of the past period. REX (feedback), retrospectives‚Ä¶ They have
            several names and take several forms.

          <p id="paragraph">
            A team that resists uncertainties and knows how to adapt is better
            able to know how to react from a distance without constantly
            depending on you, who will not always be reachable or at their
            disposal.

                Our advice: the more the situation is unstable, uncertain,
                shifting, the more regularly you must invest time to stabilize
                the team.

            As Philippe Carr√©, a specialist in apprenticeship, puts it so well:

            He refers here to the social dimension of learning: what we learn at

            of those around us, etc.

            However, at a distance, there is a risk that it will stop.
            Capitalizing on experience is important, but putting in place a
            system and actions so that your team continues to update and develop
            its skills is just as important.

            From a distance, it is more difficult for new entrants to be

            therefore necessary to manage integration courses for which you will
            delegate most of the tasks, in 3 areas:
